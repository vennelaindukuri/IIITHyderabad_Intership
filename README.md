# 🧠 Internship Task 2 – Object Detection and Segmentation using YOLOv8

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **object detection and segmentation** using the **YOLOv8** model from the **Ultralytics** library.  
The goal was to detect and segment objects in three categories of images — **animals**, **fruits**, and **traffic** — and evaluate the model’s performance metrics.

# 🎥 Internship Task 3 — Video to Object Detection using YOLO and FFmpeg

## 📌 Objective
In this task, we take a **video clip** from a public source, convert it into a **sequence of image frames**, run **object detection** on each frame using the **YOLOv8 model**, and finally **reconstruct the processed frames back into a video**.

This experiment demonstrates how object detection can be extended from still images to videos using a frame-by-frame approach.
